    To date, most sequencing efforts have been optimized for understanding and treating Mendelian diseases and rare genetic disorders. 
    By contrast, our progress in unraveling the biology of complex diseases has been far more limited. What we urgently need are tools 
    that can map the <i>functional</i> genome - not just the sequence of DNA, but how it is expressed and regulated in living cells.
  </p>
  <p>
    Every species is composed of tens of thousands of unique proteins. In humans, for example, a repertoire of more than 100,000 distinct protein 
    isoforms is generated from roughly 20,000 protein-coding genes. These isoforms account for much of the phenotypic variability observed between
    cell types, among individuals, and across species. Yet we currently lack the tools to comprehensively map the full diversity of isoforms produced
    by each gene within the context of each cell. Equally underexplored are post-translational modifications (PTMs), which add another critical layer
    of functional diversity to the proteome.
