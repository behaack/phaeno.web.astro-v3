    <HorizonalListItem>
      <h4 class="font-bold">Full-length coverage</h4>
      <p>Captures entire RNA molecules end-to-end, resolving isoforms, splice variants, and UTRs that short-read RNA-Seq fragments miss.</p>
    </HorizonalListItem>
    <HorizonalListItem>
      <h4 class="font-bold">Compatibility with standard NGS</h4>
      <p>Runs on widely deployed short-read sequencers (Illumina, Element, etc.), avoiding reliance on expensive, low-throughput long-read platforms.</p>
    </HorizonalListItem>
    <HorizonalListItem>
      <h4 class="font-bold">Higher accuracy & reproducibility</h4>
      <p>Leverages the base-calling accuracy and depth of short-read instruments while retaining full-length information.</p>
    </HorizonalListItem>
    <HorizonalListItem>
      <h4 class="font-bold">Scalable & automated workflow</h4>
      <p>No need for proprietary hardware or complex manual bioinformatics pipelines.</p>
    </HorizonalListItem>
    <HorizonalListItem>
      <h4 class="font-bold">Multi-omics bridge</h4>
      <p>By mapping the true isoform landscape, PSeq provides a clearer link between RNA expression, protein isoforms, and functional outcomes.</p>
    </HorizonalListItem>
    <HorizonalListItem>
      <h4 class="font-bold">Lower cost per sample</h4>
      <p>Efficient chemistry and use of existing sequencing infrastructure reduce cost compared to long-read RNA sequencing.</p>
    </HorizonalListItem>
  </HorizonalList>     
  <h4>While PSeq doesn’t directly detect RNA modifications, it provides the isoform-resolved framework that makes studying modifications in context possible — something conventional short-read RNA sequencing lacks.</h4>  
  <h3 class="mt-3">How PSeq improved multi-omics</h3>
  <p>
    Multi-omics promises a “holistic” view of biology, but in practice it is fragile, error-prone, and prohibitively complex.
    Measurement errors compound across layers, integration methods rely on shaky assumptions, and costs escalate beyond practicality. 
    Instead of yielding clarity, multi-omics often produces an overfit, expensive, and irreproducible data swamp — where the signal 
    is easily drowned out by noise.

    To date, most sequencing efforts have been optimized for understanding and treating Mendelian diseases and rare genetic disorders. 
    By contrast, our progress in unraveling the biology of complex diseases has been far more limited. What we urgently need are tools 
    that can map the <i>functional</i> genome - not just the sequence of DNA, but how it is expressed and regulated in living cells.
  </p>
  <p>
    Every species is composed of tens of thousands of unique proteins. In humans, for example, a repertoire of more than 100,000 distinct protein 
    isoforms is generated from roughly 20,000 protein-coding genes. These isoforms account for much of the phenotypic variability observed between
    cell types, among individuals, and across species. Yet we currently lack the tools to comprehensively map the full diversity of isoforms produced
    by each gene within the context of each cell. Equally underexplored are post-translational modifications (PTMs), which add another critical layer
    of functional diversity to the proteome.
