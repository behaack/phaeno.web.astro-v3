    <h2>Until now, we have lacked the tools necessary to map phenotypic drivers</h2>
  </div>
  <p class="mt-2">
    Every species is made up of tens of thousands of unique proteins. For example, humans are made up of at least 400,000 different unique proteins. 
    These proteins are the ultimate drivers of phenotypic variabilitity between the cells of a species and across species. To gain a fuller 
    understanding of biology and disease, what is needed is a <i>comprehensive</i> understanding of the drivers of protein variability.
  </p>
  <h3>Current analytical methods fall short.</h3>
  <p>While multi-omics is a steep in the right direction, current analytic methods fall fer short of being able to generate a comprehensive understanding of biological variabilitlty.</p>
