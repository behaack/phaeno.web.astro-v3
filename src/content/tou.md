2.2 Subscription. You may only use the Service according to the rights granted under (and the other terms and conditions of) these Terms of Service and the Key Subscription Terms, and only for your own internal business purposes (or, if you a non-fee-paying Subscriber, only for your own internal, non-commercial academic or research purposes) (the “Specified Purpose”). Phaeno shall make the Service available to Subscriber through Registered Users’ (as defined below) use of supported and properly configured web browsers. Subscriber agrees that, except as set forth in the Key Subscription Terms, its purchase of subscriptions for the Service is neither contingent upon the delivery of any future functionality or features nor dependent upon any oral or written statements or commitments made by Phaeno with respect to future functionality or features.

2.3 Limitations. We may alter, suspend, or discontinue the Service, in whole or in part, at any time and for any reason, without notice. We may restrict access to portions of the Service, for some or all users, from time to time. The Service may also periodically become unavailable due to maintenance or malfunction of computer equipment or for other reasons.

2.4 Registration. To use certain features of the Service, you may be required to register your employees or independent contractors (“Registered Users”), each of whom will choose a username, provide an email address, and create a password (“Login Credentials”). Each Registered User is responsible for keeping registration information up to date, protecting Login Credentials from unauthorized use, and for all activity that occurs on such Registered User’s account (including financial obligations). Each Registered User shall log in to the Service using the unique username and password associated with such Registered User. You shall not permit any person to use a Registered User’s username and password to log in and access the Service other than the Registered User associated with such username and password. You agree to notify us immediately if you believe that the Login Credentials of any Registered User have been or may be used without permission so that appropriate action can be taken. We are not responsible for losses or damage caused by your failure to safeguard Login Credentials. We have the right to disable any Registered User’s account at any time in our sole discretion for any or no reason, including if, in our opinion, you have violated any provision of these Terms.

2.5 Access. Registered Users shall be solely responsible, at each one’s expense, for establishing, maintaining, and operating their connection to the Internet (the speed of which may have a significant impact on the responsiveness of the Service), including all access lines, all Internet service provider connection charges, and any long distance telephone charges.

2.6 Subscriber Responsibilities. Subscriber shall comply with all applicable local, state, federal and foreign laws in using the Service, and shall be responsible for all activities undertaken under Registered Users’ accounts and for Registered Users’ compliance with these Terms and with any applicable Key Subscription Terms.

2.8 Security. As part of the Service, Phaeno (or its subcontractors and suppliers) shall use good faith efforts to implement security measures (such as password protection and encryption) and maintain such other safeguards (including malware protection safeguards) which are reasonably intended to prevent the destruction, loss, interception, or alteration of Submitted Content by unauthorized persons and which are consistent with current commercial practices in the industry. The parties expressly recognize that, although Phaeno shall take such reasonable steps, or cause such reasonable steps to be taken, to prevent security breaches, it is impossible to maintain flawless security. Subscriber will not attempt to disable, modify or circumvent any security safeguard adopted by Phaeno.

**3. Data and Content Rights and Obligations**

3.1 Submitted Content. All Submitted Content must comply with the restrictions set forth in these Terms, including the Content Standards (as defined below).

3.4 Subscriber Representations.

3.5 Content Restrictions. We have the right to:

(i) Remove or refuse to post any Submitted Content for any or no reason at our sole discretion.

(ii) Take any action with respect to any Submitted Content that we deem necessary or appropriate in our sole discretion, including if we believe that such Submitted Content violates these Terms, including the Content Standards, infringes any intellectual property right or other right of any person or entity, threatens the personal safety of users of the Service or the public, or could create liability for Phaeno.

(iii) Disclose your identity or other information about you to any third party who claims that material posted by you violates their rights, including their intellectual property rights or their right to privacy.

(iv) Take appropriate legal action, including referral to law enforcement, for any illegal or unauthorized use of the Service.

**4. Confidentiality Obligations**

4.1 Confidential Information. From time to time, either party (the “Disclosing Party”) may disclose or make available to the other party (the “Receiving Party”), whether orally or in physical form, confidential or proprietary information concerning the Disclosing Party and/or its business, products, customers, services, policyholders and/or claimants, including information and/or documents concerning; (i) financial information, strategic business plans, policies and/or methods; (ii) marketing, claims, sales, underwriting strategy, and decision making processes; (iii) pricing and/or profit information; (iv) lists of actual or prospective customers; (v) proprietary and/or confidential intellectual property; and (vi) intellectual property of third parties licensed to the disclosing party (collectively, “Confidential Information”). Each party agrees that during the term hereof and thereafter: (i) it will use Confidential Information belonging to the Disclosing Party solely for the purpose(s) of these Terms; and (ii) it will take reasonable precautions, but no less than it would take to prevent the disclosure of its own similar Confidential Information, to ensure that it does not disclose Confidential Information belonging to the Disclosing Party to any third party (other than the Receiving Party’s employees, contractors, and/or professional advisors on a need-to-know basis who are bound by obligations of nondisclosure and limited use at least as stringent as those contained herein) without first obtaining the Disclosing Party’s written consent. Upon request by the Disclosing Party, the Receiving Party will return to the Disclosing Party, or destroy, all copies of any Confidential Information. For Confidential Information that does not constitute trade secrets under applicable law, these confidentiality obligations will expire three (3) years after the termination or expiration of these Terms, and for Confidential Information that constitutes trade secrets shall survive until such Confidential Information ceases to be a trade secret. The Receiving Party will be responsible for any breach of this Section 4.1 by its employees, representatives, and agents. Non-public information regarding the Service (including their performance, operation, and data formats) and any documentation relating to the Service are the Confidential Information of Phaeno. The terms of any Vendor Quote (including the Key Subscription Terms) are the Confidential Information of both Phaeno, but may be disclosed by Subscriber to its advisors and potential investors or acquirers who are subject to confidentiality obligations at least as restrictive as those set forth herein.

4.2 Exclusions from Confidential Information. For purposes hereof, “Confidential Information” will not include any information that the Receiving Party can establish by convincing written evidence: (i) was independently developed by the Receiving Party without use of or reference to any Confidential Information belonging to the Disclosing Party; (ii) was acquired by the Receiving Party from a third party having the legal right to furnish same to the Receiving Party; or (iii) was at the time in question (whether at disclosure or thereafter) generally known by or available to the public (through no fault of the Receiving Party).

4.3 Equitable Relief. The Receiving Party acknowledges that disclosure of Confidential Information would cause substantial harm for which damages alone would not be a sufficient remedy, and therefore that upon any such disclosure by the Receiving Party the Disclosing Party shall be entitled to seek appropriate equitable relief in addition to whatever other remedies it might have at law.

4.4 Required Disclosures. The confidentiality obligations herein will not restrict any disclosure required by order of a court or any government agency, provided that, to the extent permitted by law, the Receiving Party gives prompt notice to the Disclosing Party of any such order and reasonably cooperates with the Disclosing Party at the Disclosing Party’s request and expense to resist such order or to obtain a protective order. YOU WAIVE AND HOLD HARMLESS Phaeno AND ITS AFFILIATES, LICENSEES AND SERVICE PROVIDERS FROM ANY CLAIMS RESULTING FROM ANY ACTION TAKEN BY ANY OF THE FOREGOING PARTIES DURING, OR TAKEN AS A CONSEQUENCE OF, INVESTIGATIONS BY SUCH PARTIES OR LAW ENFORCEMENT AUTHORITIES.

You agree to defend, indemnify, and hold harmless Phaeno, its affiliates, licensors, and service providers, and its and their respective officers, directors, employees, contractors, agents, licensors, suppliers, successors, and assigns from and against any claims, liabilities, damages, judgments, awards, losses, costs, expenses, or fees (including reasonable attorneys’ fees) arising out of or relating to your violation of these Terms or your use of the Service, including your Submitted Content, any use of the Service other than as expressly authorized in these Terms or your use of any information obtained from the Service. Subscriber shall defend, indemnify, and hold harmless Phaeno and its officers, directors, employees, and shareholders from and against any and all any Damages, including reasonable legal fees and expenses, arising out of any third party Claim that any Submitted Content infringes the patent, copyright or other intellectual property right of any third party or violates any laws, including privacy laws.

12.3 Indemnification Claims. If Subscriber or Phaeno intends to claim indemnification hereunder (for itself or for another indemnitee) with respect to any Damages arising under a Claim, then Subscriber or Phaeno (the “Indemnified Party”) shall promptly notify the other party (the “Indemnifying Party”) of any Claim in respect of which the Indemnified Party (whether for itself or for one of the persons entitled to indemnification under previous two paragraphs) intends to claim such indemnification reasonably promptly after the Indemnified Party is aware thereof, and the Indemnifying Party shall assume the defense of any related third party action, suit or proceeding with counsel of the Indemnifying Party’s choice. The indemnity agreement in this Section 12 shall not apply to amounts paid in settlement of any claim, loss, damage or expense if such settlement is effected without the consent of the Indemnifying Party, whose consent shall not be unreasonably withheld or delayed. The failure of the Indemnified Party to deliver notice to the Indemnifying Party within a reasonable time after the Indemnified Party becomes aware of any such matter, if prejudicial to Indemnifying Party’s ability to defend such action, shall relieve the Indemnifying Party of any liability under this Section 12 with respect to such Claim. The Indemnified Party and all indemnitees shall cooperate fully with the Indemnifying Party and its legal representatives in the investigation of any matter covered by this indemnification.

12.4 Contingency. Should the Service become, or in Phaeno’ opinion, be likely to become the subject of a claim or an injunction preventing its use as contemplated herein, Phaeno may, at its option (i) procure for Subscriber the right to continue to access the Service hereunder, (ii) replace or modify the Service so that they become non-infringing, or, if Phaeno determines, in its sole discretion, that (i) and (ii) are not commercially practical for Phaeno, then (iii) Phaeno may terminate these Terms and applicable Key Subscription Terms and refund to Subscriber a prorated amount of the subscription fees paid in advance based on the remaining portion of the then current Subscription Term for which such subscription fees were paid.

**13. Limitation of Liability**

TO THE FULLEST EXTENT PROVIDED BY LAW, IN NO EVENT WILL Phaeno, ITS AFFILIATES, OR THEIR LICENSORS, SERVICE PROVIDERS, EMPLOYEES, AGENTS, OFFICERS, OR DIRECTORS BE LIABLE FOR DAMAGES OF ANY KIND, UNDER ANY LEGAL THEORY, ARISING OUT OF OR IN CONNECTION WITH YOUR USE, OR INABILITY TO USE, THE SERVICE, ANY SERVICES LINKED TO IT, ANY CONTENT ON THE SERVICE OR SUCH OTHER SERVICES, INCLUDING ANY DIRECT, INDIRECT, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL, CONSEQUENTIAL, OR PUNITIVE DAMAGES, INCLUDING PERSONAL INJURY, PAIN AND SUFFERING, EMOTIONAL DISTRESS, LOSS OF REVENUE, LOSS OF PROFITS, LOSS OF BUSINESS OR ANTICIPATED SAVINGS, LOSS OF USE, LOSS OF GOODWILL, LOSS OF DATA, AND WHETHER CAUSED BY TORT (INCLUDING NEGLIGENCE), BREACH OF CONTRACT, OR OTHERWISE, EVEN IF FORESEEABLE. Phaeno’ MAXIMUM AGGREGATE LIABILITY TO YOU WITH RESPECT TO ANY DAMAGES ARISING IN CONNECTION WITH THESE TERMS OR THE USE OF THE SERVICE OR CONTENT PROVIDED THROUGH OUT THE SERVICE SHALL BE THE GREATER OF $100 OR THE AMOUNT OF ANY FEES RECEIVED BY Phaeno FROM YOU DURING THE SIX-MONTH PERIOD PRIOR TO THE DATE ON WHICH THE CAUSE OF ACTION ACCRUED, WHETHER SUCH DAMAGES ARISE IN CONTRACT, TORT (INCLUDING NEGLIGENCE), OR OTHERWISE. THE FOREGOING REMEDIES AND LIMITATIONS SHALL APPLY NOTWITHSTANDING THAT ANY REMEDY FAILS ITS ESSENTIAL PURPOSE. THE PROVISIONS OF THIS PARAGRAPH WERE AND ARE AN EXPRESS PART OF THE BARGAIN BETWEEN YOU AND Phaeno AND WERE A CONTROLLING FACTOR IN THE SETTING OF ANY FEES PAYABLE TO Phaeno.

THE FOREGOING DOES NOT AFFECT ANY LIABILITY THAT CANNOT BE EXCLUDED OR LIMITED UNDER APPLICABLE LAW.

**14. General Provisions**

14.2 Cloud Services and Third Party Services. You acknowledge that the Service is hosted by third party cloud providers, which may change from time to time (the “Cloud Providers”), and that your use of the Service is subject to any applicable restrictions or requirements imposed by the Cloud Providers. In addition, if you are not a fee-paying Subscriber, without limitation of the disclaimers and limitations of liability set forth in Section 13, you acknowledge and agree that (a) the price at which we could afford to offer the Service would vary if we provided the Service other than using such cloud services; and (b) we shall not be responsible or liable to you for any act, omission or failure of any Cloud Provider.

The Service may depend upon, interact with or enable access to third parties’ information, other content, services or websites (each, a “Third Party Service”), which may in each case be accompanied by separate terms of use. Use of each Third Party Service may require that you accept additional terms of use. You must comply with the applicable terms of use when using the Third Party Service and the Service. Company does not endorse, and hereby disclaims all liability or responsibility to you or any other person for, any Third Party Services.

14.3 Geographic Restrictions. The owner of the Service is based in the United States. We make no claims that the Service is accessible or appropriate outside of the United States.

14.4 Publicity. Terms do not grant either party the right to use any trademark, trade name or logo of the other party in any advertising or promotional material, except that: (i) Phaeno may identify Subscriber as a customer of Phaeno, including as a subscriber of the Service, in promotional materials and published lists of Phaeno’ customers; and (ii) Subscriber may disclose its use of the Service to its customers for purposes of promoting the use of the Service to Phaeno’ customers. Subscriber agrees that Phaeno may issue a press release, in a form to be mutually agreed by Subscriber and Phaeno, describing this subscription including a quote from Subscriber.

14.5 Entire Agreement. These Terms constitute the entire agreement between Phaeno and yourself with respect to the subject matter hereof and thereof, and supersedes any prior agreement between the parties with respect to the subject matter hereof, except as otherwise provided in a Separate Agreement. No terms or conditions in any purchase order issued by yourself under these Terms, including in response to any Key Subscription Terms, shall apply and any such purchase order terms or conditions shall be superseded by these Terms and any applicable Key Subscription Terms, except that, as applicable, such purchase order shall evidence your acceptance of the applicable Key Subscription Terms, including your election of any options or choices expressly contemplated by such Key Subscription Terms.

14.6 Severability. In the event that any provision of these Terms are held by a court of competent jurisdiction to be unenforceable because it is invalid or in conflict with any law of any relevant jurisdiction, the validity of the remaining provisions shall not be affected, and the rights and obligations of the parties shall be construed and enforced as if these Terms did not contain the particular provisions held to be unenforceable.

14.7 Assignments. Neither these Terms nor any rights or obligations hereunder may be assigned or delegated by either party, including by operation of law, without the prior written consent of the other party, except that (a) Phaeno may without such consent assign these Terms as a whole to (i) an affiliate or (ii) a successor or acquirer in connection with a merger, reorganization or sale of all or substantially all of its assets or business to which these Terms relate, and (b) if Subscriber is not paying Phaeno for its use of the Service, Phaeno may without such consent assign these Terms or any of its rights or obligations hereunder to any affiliate or third party. These Terms shall inure to the benefit of the parties and their permitted successors and assigns.

14.8 Notices. Any notice by a party under these Terms shall be delivered in writing either by electronic mail or hard copy. E-mail notices should be sent to Phaeno at info@Phaeno.com, and to you at the email address provided at registration. Hard copies may be personally delivered via reputable overnight courier (such as Federal Express) or certified mail, postage prepaid and return receipt requested addressed to the other party as follows:

To Phaeno: Phaeno, Inc., 68 Harrison Ave #605, PMB 29417, Boston, MA 02111

To You: to the address provided at registration; or, in each case, such other address of which either party may from time to time notify the other in accordance with this Section 14.8. All notices shall be in English and shall be deemed effective on the date of personal delivery, one business day after deposit with an overnight courier, or five business days after deposit in the mail.

14.9 Governing Law; Venue. The validity, construction and interpretation of these Terms, and the rights and duties of the parties, shall be governed by and construed in accordance with the laws of the state of Delaware, U.S.A., without giving effect to the conflict of law provisions thereof, and excluding any application of the United Nations Convention on Contracts for the International Sale of Goods.

14.10 Arbitration. We will attempt to resolve disputes with Subscribers or other users to their satisfaction. If, however, a matter arises that cannot be resolved promptly between you and us, you agree that any disputes arising out of or relating to the Service or these Terms (including the validity and scope of the agreement to arbitrate and any disputes with other users of the Service) shall be resolved exclusively by final and binding arbitration administered by the American Arbitration Association (“AAA”) under the Federal Arbitration Act, and shall be conducted before a single arbitrator pursuant to the applicable Rules and Procedures established by the AAA (for information on the AAA and its rules, see adr.org). You agree that the arbitration shall be held in Boston, Massachusetts, unless the AAA or the arbitrator shall determine that venue in such city is unreasonably burdensome, in which case the AAA or the arbitrator shall select a venue that is not unreasonably burdensome to both you and us. You agree that, if the AAA shall be unavailable or decline to administer the arbitration, and the parties do not agree on a substitute, a substitute administrator or arbitrator shall be appointed by the court. The arbitrator may render early or summary disposition of some or all issues, after the parties have had a reasonable opportunity to make submissions on these issues. At Phaeno’ option, this provision shall not apply to claims of patent, trademark, or copyright infringement or misappropriation of trade secrets (collectively, “IP Claims”). In addition, you or we may elect to bring an individual claim in a small claims court, but we do not hereby agree to any personal jurisdiction that is otherwise lacking.

You agree that any arbitration shall not permit claims on a class, mass, representative, or private attorney general basis. You further agree that no claims of other parties may be consolidated with your or our claims in the arbitration without both your and our consent. YOU ARE WAIVING YOUR RIGHTS TO HAVE YOUR CASE DECIDED BY A JURY AND TO PARTICIPATE IN A CLASS, MASS, REPRESENTATIVE, PRIVATE ATTORNEY GENERAL, OR CONSOLIDATED ACTION AGAINST US.

If any part of this Arbitration clause is later deemed invalid as a matter of law, then it shall be severed and the remaining portions of this Section 14.10 shall remain in effect, with the exception that if the preceding paragraph is deemed invalid, then this entire Section 14.10 shall be deemed invalid and the arbitration clause shall be void.

14.11 Jurisdiction. With respect to any IP Claims that are not subject to arbitration under the above provision, you hereby consent to non-exclusive jurisdiction and venue in any federal or state court located within the Commonwealth of Massachusetts, U.S.A., with respect to any suit, claim or cause of action arising from or relating to the Service or these Terms, and you shall not bring any such suit, claim or cause of action except in a court located within the Commonwealth of Massachusetts, U.S.A.

14.12 No Waiver. The waiver by either party of a breach of a default of any provision of these Terms by the other party shall not be construed as a waiver of any succeeding breach of the same or any other provision, nor shall any delay or omission on the part of either party to exercise or avail itself of any right, power or privilege that it has, or may have thereunder, operate as a waiver of any right, power or privilege by such party.

14.13 Section Headings; Interpretation. Captions and section headings hereof are for reference purposes only and shall not control or alter the meaning of these Terms as set forth in the text. As used herein and unless the intent is expressly otherwise in a specific instance, the terms “include,” “includes” or “including” shall not be limiting and “or” shall not be exclusive.

14.14 Force Majeure. In the event that either party is unable to perform any of its obligations under these Terms (except for payment obligations) because of causes beyond its reasonable control or because of any Act of God, accident to equipment or machinery; any fire, flood, hurricane, tornado, storm or other weather condition; any war, act of war, act of public enemy, terrorist act, sabotage, riot, civil disorder, act or decree of any governmental body; any failure of communications lines, transportation, light, electricity or power; any earthquake, civil disturbance, commotion, lockout, strike or other labor or industrial disturbance; or any illness, epidemic, quarantine, death or any other natural or artificial disaster the party who has been so affected shall immediately give notice to the other party and shall undertake commercially reasonable efforts to resume performance as promptly as reasonably practicable. Upon receipt of such notice, all obligations under these Terms shall be immediately suspended and performance times shall be considered extended for a period of time equivalent to the time lost because of any such delay.

14.15 Relationship of the Parties. The parties are independent contractors. These Terms do not create a partnership, franchise, joint venture, agency, fiduciary or employment relationship between the parties.

14.16 Execution; Versions. These Terms may be executed electronically, and your electronic assent or use of the Service shall constitute execution of these Terms. You agree that the electronic text of these Terms constitutes a writing and your assent to the terms and conditions hereof constitutes a “signing” for all purposes. This version of these Terms became effective on the date first listed above and amends, restates and replaces any version effective prior to such date (including prior versions referred to as the “Terms of Use for Phaeno Website and Phaeno Platform” or “Terms of Use”).
